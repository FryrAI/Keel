# keel — Code Graph Enforcement

This project uses keel (keel.engineer) for code graph enforcement.
Hooks handle automatic validation. Follow this workflow for proactive checks:

## Mandatory workflow:
1. Before editing a function with callers (↑ > 0), run: `keel discover <hash>`
2. After EVERY file edit, `keel compile` runs automatically via hooks
3. If errors returned, FIX THEM immediately
4. Type hints mandatory. Docstrings mandatory on public functions.
5. Check map before creating new functions. Place in correct module.

## Commands:
- `keel discover <hash>` — callers, callees, module context
- `keel compile <file>` — validate (auto-runs via hooks, can also run manually)
- `keel where <hash>` — resolve hash to file:line
