## Brand Story

### The Name

A **keel** is the structural backbone of a ship — the first piece laid, the last to break. Every plank, rib, and mast connects to it. Without the keel, a hull is just lumber.

Software has the same problem. AI agents generate code fast, but they don't understand the structure holding it together. They add planks without checking the keel. keel is the tool that makes structure visible, enforceable, and real-time.

### The Nautical Thread

The nautical metaphor runs deep — and it's not accidental:

- **keel** (the tool) = the structural backbone of a codebase
- **Claude** (Anthropic's model, our primary integration) = named after Claude Shannon, but its brand mascot is a **crab** — a creature that lives where ocean meets structure
- **Coral** (our accent color) = the living architecture of the ocean — organic, structural, resilient
- **Teal** (our primary color) = deep water — calm, precise, trustworthy

The brand sits at the intersection of **engineering precision** and **ocean depth**. We're not playful-nautical (no anchors, no ship wheels). We're structural-nautical: the geometry beneath the waterline.

### What keel Does (One Sentence)

keel builds a real-time structural graph of your codebase and enforces architectural contracts at generation time — before broken code ever reaches review.

### Who It's For

- **AI coding agents** (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Aider, Windsurf) that need structural guardrails
- **Engineering teams** shipping AI-generated code who need confidence it won't break the architecture
- **Solo developers** who want a fast, zero-dependency structural linter

### The Promise

> You wouldn't build a ship without a keel. Why build software without one?

## Brand Principles

### 1. Structure Over Decoration
Every visual element should communicate structure. No gradients for the sake of gradients, no illustrations that don't teach. If it doesn't reinforce the idea of structural integrity, cut it.

### 2. Dark-Mode Native
Developers live in dark mode. Our brand is designed dark-first, with light mode as a derived variant. Dark backgrounds, bright accents, high contrast.

### 3. Terminal-Authentic
keel is a CLI tool. The brand should feel at home next to a terminal. Monospace code blocks are first-class citizens, not afterthoughts. Screenshots show real output, not mockups.

### 4. Precision, Not Flash
We're not a design tool or a social platform. Our aesthetic is **engineering precision**: clean lines, consistent spacing, deliberate color use. Think technical drawing, not marketing collateral.

### 5. The Claude Connection (Subtle)
Our coral accent (`#E8734A`) intentionally sits near Claude's brand orange (`#DE7356`). This is a quiet nod — not a co-brand. We're part of the ecosystem, not dependent on it.
